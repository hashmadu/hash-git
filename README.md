# hash-git

Rosha.. Plesae check the uploaded Ajax_Test folder. There are 3 files(JS, PHP, HTML).
JS has some issues while checking of XMLHttpRequest.state & state.

The purpose on html file is, when you enter some food in to the text box, some comment will be showed on there that food is available or not at the same time.

:( but it is not working...
